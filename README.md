# How_Linux_Works_2014ed
The official page of the book
http://www.nostarch.com/howlinuxworks2#updates
Today (23 Apr 2015) there is only one errata in the webpage:
In Section 2.18.2 on page 37, the sentence "The r and f flags have more specific roles."
should read "The v and f flags have more specific roles."
I will post my findings for other errata , and some questions that raise while reading the text , 
and will trigger for more investigation on my part.
