#page 90-91 5.5.3 in paragraph Installing GRUB on an External Storage Device
the book mentions :
grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdc , but it seems wrong and the correct should be :
  grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdc


#page 121-122 6.7 Shutting Down Your System
  The book mentions 
1. init asks every process to shut down cleanly.
2. If a process doesn’t respond after a while, init kills it, first trying a TERM signal.
3. If the TERM signal doesn’t work, init uses the KILL signal on any stragglers.
4. The system locks system files into place and makes other preparations for shutdown.
5. The system unmounts all filesystems other than the root.
6. The system remounts the root filesystem read-only.
7. The system writes all buffered data out to the filesystem with the sync program.
8. The final step is to tell the kernel to reboot or stop with the reboot(2) system call. This can be done by init
or an auxiliary program such as reboot, halt, or poweroff.
  But it seems to me that this is a more logical order (I keep the original numbering) : 
1. init asks every process to shut down cleanly.
2. If a process doesn’t respond after a while, init kills it, first trying a TERM signal. 
3. If the TERM signal doesn’t work, init uses the KILL signal on any stragglers.
7. The system writes all buffered data out to the filesystem with the sync program.
4. The system locks system files into place and makes other preparations for shutdown.
5. The system unmounts all filesystems other than the root.
6. The system remounts the root filesystem read-only.
8. The final step is to tell the kernel to reboot or stop with the reboot(2) system call. This can be done by init
