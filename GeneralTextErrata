#page 90-91 5.5.3 in paragraph Installing GRUB on an External Storage Device
  the book mentions :
grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdc , but it seems wrong and 
  the correct should be :
grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdc


#page 121-122 6.7 Shutting Down Your System
  The book mentions 
1. init asks every process to shut down cleanly.
2. If a process doesn’t respond after a while, init kills it, first trying a TERM signal.
3. If the TERM signal doesn’t work, init uses the KILL signal on any stragglers.
4. The system locks system files into place and makes other preparations for shutdown.
5. The system unmounts all filesystems other than the root.
6. The system remounts the root filesystem read-only.
7. The system writes all buffered data out to the filesystem with the sync program.
8. The final step is to tell the kernel to reboot or stop with the reboot(2) system call. This can be done by init
or an auxiliary program such as reboot, halt, or poweroff.
  But it seems to me that this is a more logical order (I keep the original numbering) : 
1. init asks every process to shut down cleanly.
2. If a process doesn’t respond after a while, init kills it, first trying a TERM signal. 
3. If the TERM signal doesn’t work, init uses the KILL signal on any stragglers.
7. The system writes all buffered data out to the filesystem with the sync program.
4. The system locks system files into place and makes other preparations for shutdown.
5. The system unmounts all filesystems other than the root.
6. The system remounts the root filesystem read-only.
8. The final step is to tell the kernel to reboot or stop with the reboot(2) system call. This can be done by init
or an auxiliary program such as reboot, halt, or poweroff.


#page 132 7.5.2 Network time
  Book mentions :
1. Find the closest NTP time server from your ISP or from the ntp.org web page.
2. Put that time server in /etc/ntpd.conf.
  But the correct should be (1. is OK , 2. is not : ntpd should be ntp)
2. Put that time server in /etc/ntp.conf.


#page 141 7.10.2 Notes on PAM
  The book says :
To find out which PAM modules are present on your system, try man -k pam_ (note the underscore). It
can be difficult to track down the location of modules. Try the locate unix_pam.so command and see
where that leads you.
  A small error in the second sentence , it should be 
Try the locate pam_unix.so command and see where that leads you.Or use find :
find / -name '*pam_*.so' 


#page 203  10.5.3 netcat
The book mentions :
"To listen on a particular port, run
  $ netcat -l -p port_number  "
But this is wrong syntax. Reading the man pages for nc (netcat) states that option -l cannot be combined with 
some other options. At the examples section of man pages we can see how we can use the correct
$ nc -l  port_number
